# [TTK4135: Optimization and Control](https://www.ntnu.edu/studies/courses/TTK4135)

*In collaboration with [Khuong Huynh](https://github.com/Khuongh).*

This repo contains all Matlab and Simulink files for the mandatory lab exercises in the course. The lab's is to learn about practical implementation of optimal control by designing controllers for a [3-DOF helicopter](https://www.quanser.com/products/3-dof-helicopter/) and analyzing the results.
